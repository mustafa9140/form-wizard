I have breaked all the app into Four major components for this app.

The architectural structure of the app has been made by keeping in mind only this kind of apps where multiple steps are involved, we can extend it however many steps we may require

For form validations I have Vee Validate and Yup npm packages, it stable than custom validations

I have made the app Mobile Responsive as well

Skipped Bootstarp or any such API as directed

There are many other options available for acheiving the same thing, I have implemented few things just same as I have been using them in big Apps

I have breaked all the app into Four major components

The architectural structure of the app has been made by keeping in mind only this kind of apps where multiple steps are involved, we can extend it however many steps we may require

For form validations I have used Vee Validate and Yup npm packages, it stable than custom validations for me

I have made the app Mobile Responsive as well

Skipped Bootstarp or any such Library as directed

There are many other options available for acheiving the same things, I have implemented few things just same as I have been experiencing them in bigger apps

The formula calculation is reactive

Used SCSS, because it is easy to manage for developers

Implemented different route for each screen

Tried to make the overall experience of the app as smooth as possible in the shorter time

Did some basic stylings to make the app look a little cooler

Tried to match the mockup together with the moder design patterns

Used query parameters for Summary page, although VUEX or component props are also the options that can be utillised
